/**
 * @REDUXING -- State Design
 * Whenever I have a list of data which is used often accross the app and affects other state members I like to structure it as above,
 * using the ids of each item as a key and also giving the id to the values. Since arrays and objects in javascript are the same thing,
 * using this approach gives O(1) access to invidual items, and other cool fuctionalities by computing various maps using ids and row values
 * as described here: https://hackernoon.com/shape-your-redux-store-like-your-database-98faa4754fd5
